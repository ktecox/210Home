    <p>I have been doing all design in CSS, content only on HTML, except for a center tag or two that I plan on removing. I have been using Codepen to write everything so that I can view both the HTML and CSS at the same time, and there are immediate updates.</p>
	<p>I have been having major issues with alignment. I want everything to be in the center, and thus I used padding for the navigation bar. However, when I expanded the view that Codepen gives you to show my group members my work thus far, the navigation bar was no longer in the middle, which was disappointing to say the least. Thus, that is one of the major issues that I need to work on. Another place that I need to improve on is the resume page, and properly formatting the resume. Currently itâ€™s a big jumble, and I will be probably be making more CSS and adding in more HTML to address this problem.</p>
	<p>For the rest of this creative enterprise, I am planning to keep utilizing Codepen, though I will change the size of the preview window so that I do not run into the same problems. Other than that, I will just keep checking everything, and will move the code to my website that is actually on the Internet to make sure that everything works.</p>
