			<p>Personally, my SCRUM group did not provide me much advice. I had a very set vision, 
			and I knew exactly what I wanted my page to look like—lots of pink, and very, very 
			simple. They overall liked my color scheme, and felt that I had a grasp on the design 
			of my website. The one area in which they really directed the future of my portfolio 
			was in eliminating one of the pages. I originally had five different pages on my 
			website: home, about, portfolio, resume, and contact. My group helped me realize that 
			I am not that complex of a person, and that really, my about page was merely a 
			repetition of my home page, and due to their advice, I cut it out, something that then 
			caused its own fair share of problems with realignment.</p> 
			<p>However, I felt as though I helped my group members, and was hopefully not too 
			harsh with my suggestions. One of my group members, Ian, had some serious struggles 
			with his original color scheme, and I think the advice I gave him about sticking with 
			a palate that matched his pirate flag was helpful, or at least I hope it was. Another 
			group member of mine, Chris was stubborn about text overlapping an image on his 
			landing page, but he eventually moved it over.</p> 
			<p>I thought that portfolio days in general were very helpful. I would use those times 
			as a time to get serious work done on my portfolio, something that I was not very good 
			at apart from those times. These days were also useful because I had lots and lots of 
			questions that I could not figure out, and Google wasn’t too helpful, but I could ask 
			you, and usually figure it out, which was much better than sitting confused in my dorm 
			room.</p>
